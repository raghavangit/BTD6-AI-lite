# BTD6-AI-lite

09/03/2024

IMPORTANT: PROJECT PRIMATE (It doesn't stand for anything) is no longer being maintained, and will not work without the Huggingface space set up. It is also not updated to the latest version of MelonLoader. Some background: this was a half-joke science project by 3 high school juniors, which went on to win 3rd place in the computer science category at the Beaverton-Hillsboro Science Expo, which qualified it for the Northwest Science Expo in Portland, Oregon. We had fun developing a model framework and applying it to a game that we like. Thank you to @hihihidg for the main coding, and to the BTD6/Ninjakiwi Team for allowing us to modify their game.


INSTRUCTIONS:
First, install MelonLoader (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) to enable bloons modding. You must have a current version of bloons on steam to do this. Some recommended mods are FasterForward and BloonsModHelper. Place the TemplateMod.dll into your mods folder and run the game. This is in a prototype stage, so currently only easy maps work correctly.
Refer to MelonLoader Wiki for more information. 
You also must set up your own HuggingFace server and connect it in the ipynb file for the AI to work properly.
NOTE: If you would like to mod the game in any way, please create an alt account to do it on, to avoid getting banned on for suspicous activity by the Ninjakiwi Developers.
