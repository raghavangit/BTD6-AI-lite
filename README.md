First, install MelonLoader (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) to enable bloons modding. You must have a current version of bloons on steam to do this. Some recommended mods are FasterForward and BloonsModHelper. Place the TemplateMod.dll into your mods folder and run the game. This is in a prototype stage, so currently only easy maps work correctly.
Refer to MelonLoader Wiki for more information. 
NOTE: If you would like to mod the game in any way, please create an alt account to do it on, to avoid getting banned on your main for suspicous activity.
