# BTD6-AI-lite
A extremely low weight, very low processing time example of AI being used to play Bloons TD6. First, install MelonLoader (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) to enable bloons modding. You must have a current version of bloons on steam to do this. Some recommended mods are FasterForward and BloonsModHelper. Place the TemplateMod.dll into your mods folder and run the game. This is in a prototype stage, so currently only easy maps work correctly.
